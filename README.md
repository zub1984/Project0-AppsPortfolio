# Project0-AppsPortfolio
My Project Portfolio - P0 - This is a lightweight app.

Required Tasks

1. Create a new project in Android Studio using the "Application with blank activity" template.

2. Create a layout for your main activity, adding a title, buttons for each app, and a style of your choosing.

3. You can begin working in either the text view or design view (whichever you prefer) within Android Studio's Layout Editor.

Note that if you start in the design view, it's often a best practice to return to the text view to make final tweaks as this mode offers the most precision and control over your layout attributes.
